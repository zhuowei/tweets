I highly doubt there's anything here that's copyrightable, but in case there is, the text of the tweets here as well as any pictures created by me and uploaded to Twitter's photo hosting service can be used under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license in addition to any rights granted to you by Twitter's terms of service. (retweets, photos I took from other sites, photos that are derivatives of other works, and linked content obviously don't count)
